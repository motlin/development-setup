# git has some amazing hidden features and some terrible default configuration choices that everyone seems to change. In this section, I'm trying to only list those, and avoid personal preferences. You can think of these as bad defaults in git that ought to be changed.

# If you use different email addresses to commit to different git repositories on the same computer, it's best to avoid setting a global user.email or it's too easy to make mistakes. Git also tries to infer your email address as user@host in some situations.
# https://blog.github.com/2016-03-28-git-2-8-has-been-released/#dont-guess-my-identity
# Now you can tell Git not to guess, but rather to insist that you set user.name and user.email explicitly before it will let you commit:
git config --global user.useConfigOnly true

# Ensure that Git is properly configured to handle line endings. On OS X, you simply pass input to the configuration.

# Git should detect both renames and copies. Theoretically slows down git.

# Diffs of submodules should show the changed contents rather than a list of commits.

# git diff should use a prefix pair that is different from the standard "a/" and "b/" depending on what is being compared. Only relevant when not piping through diff-so-fancy.

# When runing git diff --color-words, git uses this regex to determinate word boundaries.

# The git rerere functionality is a bit of a hidden feature. The name stands for "reuse recorded resolution" and, as the name implies, it allows you to ask Git to remember how youâ€™ve resolved a hunk conflict so that the next time it sees the same conflict, Git can resolve it for you automatically.

# git should create a temporary stash entry before a rebase and apply it after the rebase ends. This means that you can run rebase on a dirty worktree. However, use with care: the final stash application after a successful rebase might result in non-trivial conflicts. This option can be overridden by the --no-autostash and --autostash options of git-rebase.

# TODO
# Print out the ref names of any commits that are shown by the log command. If short is specified, the ref name prefixes refs/heads/, refs/tags/ and refs/remotes/ will not be printed. If full is specified, the full ref name (including prefix) will be printed. If auto is specified, then if the output is going to a terminal, the ref names are shown as if short were given, otherwise no ref names are shown. This is the same as the --decorate option of the git log.

# In the past, git has had some terrible default options that were fixed in later versions. If you are like me, you have some now-redundant configuration and can't remember why. These --unset commands can clean up some configuration that is no longer necessary assuming you're on a reasonably modern version of git. Be careful though, these commands do not check that your configuration is in fact redundant.
